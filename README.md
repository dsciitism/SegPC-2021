This is the official repository for the ISBI 2021 paper __Transformer Assisted Convolutional Neural Network for Cell Instance Segmentation__ by Deepanshu Pandey, Pradyumna Gupta, Sumit Bhattacharya, Aman Sinha, Rohit Agarwal.

# About the Challenge
**Website link:** https://segpc-2021.grand-challenge.org/SegPC-2021/

**Overview:** In recent years, with the advancement of Deep Learning, there has been tremendous efforts in the application of image processing to build AI based models for cancer diagnosis. This challenge is also one such effort. It deals with the segmentation of plasma cell cancer, namely, Multiple Myeloma (MM), which is a type of blood cancer. We are provided with the stained color normalization imag of the cells.

**Image distribution:** The cells may have different structures because:
* There is a varying amount of nucleus and cytoplasm from one cell to another.
* The cells may appear in clusters or as isolated single cells.
* The cells appearing in clusters may have three cases - 
  * Cytoplasm of two cells touch each other,
  * The cytoplasm of one cell and nucleus of another touch each other,
  * nucleus of cells touch each other. 
  Since the cytoplasm and nucleus have different colors, the segmentation of cells may pose challenges.
* There may be multiple cells touching each other in the cluster.
* There may be unstained cells, say a red blood cell underneath the cell of interest, changing its color and shade.
* The cytoplasm of a cell may be close to the background of the whole image, making it difficult to identify the boundary of the cell and segment it.

## Getting Started
We recommend using Python 3.7 for running the scripts in this repository. The necessary packages can be installed using _requirements.txt_ in the respective folders. Since all of our work has been done on Google Colaboratory, the _requirements.txt_ may have more packages/modules than is actually required and it might take quite long to install everything. Hence,for such a case, the folders of both the models also contain an _essential-requirements.txt_ file which contains some essential packages that need to installed beforehand, while the other fundamental packages can be installed later as their need shows up as an error when running the given training and inference scripts.

To clone this repository:

 ``` $ git clone https://github.com/dsciitism/SegPC-2021```
 
 
 ### To run this repository, following the given steps using the sections mentioned in the subsequent sections:
 1) Prepare the data in COCO format
 2) Run the training script for Cascade Mask RCNN / DetectoRS
 3) Run the inference script for Cascade Mask RCNN / DetectoRS
 4) Run the ensemble script



## Data Preparation

*Note : This step is not required for inference.*

All the models present in the paper require data in COCO format to train. Hence , to train the models the images and masks need to be resized and a json file in COCO format is required. The dataset_preparation.py script in the utils folder can be used to perform these tasks. The following flags need to be used for running the dataset_preparation.py script:

```bash
usage: dataset_preparation.py [-h] --img_root IMG_ROOT --mask_root MASK_ROOT --dest_root DEST_ROOT

arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --img_root IMG_ROOT   path to the folder where the images are saved
  --mask_root MASK_ROOT
                        path to the folder where gt instances are saved
  --dest_root DEST_ROOT
                        path to the folder where the COCO format json file and resized masks and images will be saved
```
 
## Cascade Mask RCNN 

For installation of required packages:

``` $ cat Cascade_Mask_RCNN_X152/requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 pip3 install ```

                        path to the predictions of first model
  --model2_predictions MODEL2_PREDICTIONS
                        path to the predictions of second model
  --model3_predictions MODEL3_PREDICTIONS
                        path to the predictions of third model
